We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large
networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization.
It is shown to outperform all other known community detection method in terms of
computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as
measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language
communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by
analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The
accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks.
